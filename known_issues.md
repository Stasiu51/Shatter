UI
1. When zooming into the timeline, at some point it starts zooming non-uniformly, stretching horizontally
2. When zooming into the timeline, the grey 'when are we now' bar becomes too short
3. The sheets dropdown extends off to the left of the panels, and is too wide. seems to be dependent on how many boxes are ticked.

FUNCTIONALITY
1. the ROUTE=TORUS or whatever is redundant. everything should use the given embedding, which by default is plane.
